# TODO

## Completed

- [x] Chain approval buttons - cleaner layout:
  - Row 1: ⏩ Approve Chain (full width)
  - Row 2: ✅ Step | 📝 Always...
  - Row 3: ❌ Deny | 💬 Deny...

- [x] Smarter "All X" button for Bash commands:
  - Shows "All git *" instead of "All Bash"
  - Falls back to "All Bash" if pattern can't be extracted

- [x] Richer subagent completion messages:
  - Shows task description, duration, files modified
  - Auto-dismiss after configurable time (default 60s)
  - Lazy cleanup on next hook invocation
